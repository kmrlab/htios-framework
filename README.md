## 🎯 Overview

HTIOS (Hypothesis-Testing-Implementation-Optimization-Scaling) is a comprehensive framework for sequential implementation of algorithmic trading strategies in institutional funds. Developed with best practices in quantitative analysis and risk management, the framework provides a structured approach from idea to strategy scaling.

The framework combines the expertise of quantitative analysts, machine learning specialists, algorithmic trading programmers, mathematicians, fund managers, and risk managers to create robust, profitable trading strategies.

## ✨ Features

- **5-Stage Framework**: Complete methodology from hypothesis to scaling
- **Risk Management**: CVaR optimization, drawdown constraints, and stress testing
- **Quantitative Research**: Statistical tests, stationarity analysis, and robustness validation
- **Professional Implementation**: Production-ready infrastructure and monitoring
- **Optimization Suite**: Multi-factor parameter optimization and regime adaptation
- **Scalability Focus**: Vertical and horizontal scaling methodologies
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Advanced statistical models and financial mathematics
- **Institutional Grade**: Designed for professional fund management
